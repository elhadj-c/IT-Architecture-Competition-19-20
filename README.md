# IT-Architecture-Competition-19-20

The documents in here are deliverables from a project I worked on with two of my classmates. We developed the overall architecture and design for an online learning platform as part of an extra-curricular competition. 

We had a clear problem statement, a set of features we needed to deliver, and we had to provide our epics and user stories, business processes and the mapping to those, the UX/UI architecture...Etc.

These are meant to showcase my experience in product design and management.

Enjoy :)
